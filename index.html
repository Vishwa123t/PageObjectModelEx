    Poda maire is a very gentle word in malayalam and mallu boys in particular use this at least 1001 times a day for literally anything and everything.

Some times calling your friend by this can create a genuine smile on their face.

This is one word in malayalam which unite the poor, the old , the sudus, the sangis and every other Malayalam tongued rat ass.

There is no word in malayalam more beautiful than this

And by the way the meaning of “poda myre” is

Kindly get lost you pubic hair

And this pubic hair can be yours or mine.
